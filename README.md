# Agentic‑AI Platform

> Enterprise‑Grade, Privacy‑Preserving, Self‑Improving Agents  

> Emphasizes best practices for deployment: low-latency endpoints, security, governance, and integration into enterprise workflows.

## 1. Purpose

This repository lays out the design and implementation steps for building **Agentic AI** systems—intelligent software agents that not only respond to queries but also **reason, plan, collaborate, and take actions** autonomously. 

This project provides a blueprint for developers who wish to go beyond conventional chatbots and build truly **goal-driven AI agents** while guaranteeing **data sovereignty**, **auditability**, and **low‑latency orchestration**.


## 2. Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Goal‑Driven Agents** | Multi‑step planning, tool use, and self‑reflection (tool orchestration frameworks like **LangChain**, **AutoGen**, and **CrewAI**) and reasoning with objectives and sub-goals. |
| 🗄️ **Long‑Term Memory** | Vector‑store RAG (Milvus) + episodic & semantic memory layers. |
| 🔄 **Self‑Optimisation** | RLHF loops, performance telemetry, and automated prompt refinement. |
| 🛡️ **Enterprise Security** | Zero‑Trust (Cloudflare Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)), SSO + MFA, Encrypted transit & at‑rest, SOC 2 alignment. |
| ☸️ **Cloud‑Native Ops** | Kubernetes 1.30, Helm, ArgoCD, GPU autoscaling (NVIDIA T4/A100). |
| 📊 **Observability** | OpenTelemetry, Prometheus + Grafana, LLM‑specific red/blue team dashboards. |

### Repository Structure
- **[PLANNING.md](./PLANNING.md)**: Contains the high-level vision, architecture details, technology choices, constraints, and references for the project.
- **[TASK.md](./TASK.md)**: Tracks current tasks, backlog items, and completed tasks. This file is frequently updated as the project evolves.

### How to Use
1. **Review PLANNING.md** to understand the overall approach, architecture, and design constraints.  
2. **Check TASK.md** for the current project status, tasks in progress, and future enhancements.  
3. **Contribute** by creating pull requests or issues. Always reference PLANNING.md and update TASK.md accordingly.
